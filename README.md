# Literary Analysis of Homer’s The Iliad using NLP Methods

As a creative project, I plan to inspect The Iliad of Homer using Natural Language
Processing (NLP) methods. NLP is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence which studies the
computers’ understanding of human language. Main goal of this project is to exhibit some
techniques of artificial intelligence and visualization for better understanding of the text.
After each of the results, I will answer the question "so what?". In other words, I will
explain the reasoning behind numbers referring to the text.


Use of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence in the humanities topics would
provide a bridge between ancient and contemporary worlds. Incorporating the applications
of artificial intelligence would provide many benefits for both of the sides. For example, as
we gain a better understanding of the classics, we are having an excellent application area.
Also, I believe classics may be key to the artificial intelligence understanding of emotions.
Such understanding would improve AI capabilities (which was my ENG 102 topic) as
emotions promote our cognitive skills like face recognition (J. Megill, “Emotion, cognition
and artificial intelligence”, pp. 189–199)
Also, When I proposed the project, my main goal was to trace the text The Iliad in
the context I understand, I think, I study, and I love. This project was very improving
for me in terms of both Computer Science and Science of & Humanities. I realized that
there are many university departments named "Digital Humanities", and journals like
"Journal of Digital Humanities". Digital humanities field is tightly connected with artificial
intelligence and visualization fields.

This project contains the syntactic analysis of The Iliad including most frequent words, most frequent content words, repeating phrases and semantic analysis of The Iliad including Battle Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Similarities Between Different Songs in The Iliad.
