# Literary Analysis of Homer’s The Iliad using NLP Methods

As a creative project, I plan to inspect The Iliad of Homer using Natural Language
Processing (NLP) methods. NLP is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence which studies the
computers’ understanding of human language. Main goal of this project is to exhibit some
techniques of artificial intelligence and visualization for better understanding of the text.
After each of the results, I will answer the question "so what?". In other words, I will
explain the reasoning behind numbers referring to the text.

This project contains the syntactic analysis of The Iliad including most frequent words, most frequent content words, repeating phrases and semantic analysis of The Iliad including Battle Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Similarities Between Different Songs in The Iliad.

For more information see [Final Report](Report_Final.pdf).
